This program monitors the temperature in your Recreational Vehicle and sends a text message or email if it detects over or under temperature conditions. You must edit the tempRV.c file to set your desired limits and the email addresses. This was designed so that you could leave a pet in the RV with the air conditioning or heating on but be warned of a failure of the systems. BerryLan is used to set up the WiFi credentials as these would change every time you moved the RV. Either a DHT11 or DHT22 temperature sensor can be used. I also recommend using a battery pack so you would be warned in the case of a power failure.
